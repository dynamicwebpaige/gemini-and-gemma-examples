# ü¶æ Scrappy examples for Gemini, Gemma, Imagen, etc.

This repository contains a collection of scrappy, practical examples demonstrating Google's Gemini 1.5 models, Gemma, Imagen, Veo, and potentially others.  These examples are provided as either Chrome Extensions or Google Colab notebooks, and mix and match features for the APIs (ex: Search grounding) and open-source libraries.

## üóíÔ∏è What's included?

* **Chrome Extensions:**  These extensions provide a convenient way to interact with LLMs directly within your browser. They offer pre-built prompts and functionalities for specific tasks, allowing you to quickly test and modify prompts without complex setup.

* **Google Colab Notebooks:** These notebooks provide a more in-depth exploration of prompt engineering concepts. They offer greater flexibility for customization and allow you to experiment with different parameters and techniques. They also facilitate data loading, visualization, and more complex workflows.


## üß† Models Covered

This repository aims to cover examples for the following models (and may expand in the future):

* **Gemini 1.5:** Google's powerful multimodal models, available via [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com).
* **Gemma:**  Google's family of smaller, more efficient, open models.
* **Imagen:** Google's text-to-image model.
* **Veo:** Google's text-to-video model.

## üìù Examples by Category

Examples are categorized by task and model to make it easy to find what you need.  Each example directory generally includes:

* A `README.md` file with a description of the task, instructions on how to run the example, and key takeaways.
* One or more Chrome Extension source code directories (e.g., `extension_1`, `extension_2`).
* One or more Colab notebooks (e.g., `notebook_1.ipynb`, `notebook_2.ipynb`).
